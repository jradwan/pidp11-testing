# PiDP-11 Test Utilities

Just some quick utilities I threw together to test my PiDP-11 kit (similar to what I did for my [PiDP-8](https://github.com/jradwan/pidp8-testing)).

#### LEDS-OFF ####

Sometimes during my testing I've had random LEDs get stuck on. This simple Python script turns off ALL of the LEDs.
